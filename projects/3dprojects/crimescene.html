About
An unfortunate incident has taken place in the suburbs, requiring the police to corner off an area ready for an investigation.

This is the first large scale scene/model I created to test myself in Blender. Most of the textures were from third party sites

Features
The house is not based on any house in particular. It’s a “classic” American property that has been made in Blender and textured using created, or sourced. The interior uses some premade assets from another project, Detective Office.
