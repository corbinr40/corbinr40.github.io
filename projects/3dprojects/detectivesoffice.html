About
A noire style detectives office showcased in Unreal Engine which centres on an office, which is a small cramped and messy room where a detective is currently working on a case.

Features
Made in Blender, Rendered in Unreal Engine 

A small interactive demo of a noir style detectives office.

Models
There are multiple elements to this project. Those include the desk, filling cabinet and dresser.

All elements, with draws or movable parts, are fully modular. This is because the models can potentially be used in other projects and those elements could be implemented.

Texturing
This project was quite early on, and I was mostly learning how to model, the textures are sourced from online libraries.
