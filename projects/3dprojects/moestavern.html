About
The Simpsons is a comfort show for me, something that I put on when I’m feeling low or just need a laugh. I also, somehow, know way too much about the show. I wanted to make this model to try out different types of lighting, I love the idea of how neon lights work, and Moe’s Tavern was the first one that popped into my mind. 

Features
Modelling
The Tavern has been modelled in Blender, as most of my projects are. This was one of the first buildings I made in Blender, it’s a pretty simple building so I wanted to test myself with new elements. I used the Blender Text to Mesh feature and wanted to try out the build in lighting features.

Textures
As this is a cartoon, most of the textures can be made by just using the inbuilt material tool. Blender Materials can be extremely powerful, but doesn't necessarily export the greatest for external use with out some serious fiddling. The only external made textures are the windows and some of the details for the wooden beams. Those were made in GIMP 2.0.
