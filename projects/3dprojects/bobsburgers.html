About
This is the restaurant from Fox’s animated sitcom tv show Bob’s Burgers, created by Loren Bouchard. This was created in Blender and textured using the Adobe Substance Suite.

Features
The restaurant

Bob’s Burgers is a comfort show for me. Always something to put on when I’m wanting a chuckle. This was the first building I modelled and wanted to challenge myself to do something I hadn’t done before. This was also my first foray into the Substance Suite

Modelling

Modelling the restaurant took around one week, this was down to getting the detail in the buildings skirting animation correct. I also wanted the model to feel lived in, so I added a fire escape, a back door, piping and a dumpster.

Texturing the restaurant was my first foray into using Adobe’s Substance Suite.
