Back to the Future
An Unreal Engine project, based on the 1984 hit movie Back to the Future, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. This project will be a recreation of Hill Valley town square, including the iconic Town Hall and clock tower, the surrounding shops and buildings, and the famous Delorian speeding to 88mph.

NOTE: This is still a work in process, and is a large project. I am working on many other things as well as uni. So unfortunately it’s seeming a little empty.



Hill Valley
The fictional town of Hill Valley California has seen many iterations throughout many different times. This 1955 recreation of the town square in Blender shows will show off many of the iconic locations in the stunning Unreal Engine.

Modelling Iconic Locations
The centrepiece of this recreation is the town hall/clock tower. The town hall has been recreated in Blender using set photos as a reference. The shops and cafes in Hill Valley have also been recreated to give atmosphere and make the world feel lived in and thriving.

Some assets, like paths and curbs, have been leveraged from Quixel Megascan.

Texturing Hill Valley
Most textures, such as buildings and the ground, are made using the Substance Suite. More intricate designs, like store signs, will be created using Krita.
