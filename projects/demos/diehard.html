Die Hard 
Made in Unreal Engine, based upon the 1988 movie Die Hard, directed by John McTiernan and starring Bruce Willis, this will be a small scale recreating of the Nakatomi Plaza, and surrounding area. 

NOTE: This is still a work in process, and is a large project. I am working on many other things as well as uni. So unfortunately it’s seeming a little empty.

Tower Blockout - Blender
Nakatomi Plaza
Based on Fox Plaza L.A., also known as 20th Century Studios Plaza, the Nakatomi Plaza has been recreated in Blender and textured using Substance Suite.

NOTE: This is just the blockout of the model, this is unfinished and untextured.

Model Making
The main staple of this project is Nakatomi Plaza. This was painstakingly recreated within Blender using images from the movie, recorded videos from a tour, and some promotional items released.

A few of the inside floors have been made to show a character moving around in the space.

I also recreated some of the surrounding area, to show that the city is lived in and not just a standalone building. For this, I got a screen shot from Google Maps and separated areas into small sections to tackle. I modelled a few of the iconic buildings in the area so they can be easily seen.

There have also been some cars that have been made to show the busy roads of Los Angles constantly moving and flowing in every direction possible.








Texturising
Nakatomi Plaza was textured using Substance Painter/ Substance Designer. 

Most of the external buildings will be “lazily” textured. By this, I mean they will be using flat textures/images to save on system resources as the user will not be seeing these up-close and just need to sell the idea of being realistic and not being real.

Most props textures will be made through the Substance Suite.

The city, so roads, grass and some outside props like road dividers are from Megascan

Code Creating
The project is made within Epic Game’s Unreal Engine 4. This engine was chosen as it has quite a nice learning experience as well as lots of easily accessible guides online.

Unreal Engine also has a lot of very nice graphical effects, as well as destructible environments. It also has the ability to import/create an amazing looking explosion, fire and smoke effects.

Unreal Engines blueprints feature is a really useful and tool for people who are just getting into game development as well as people who have been doing it for years. It is an extremely robust way of getting your game to work exactly how you want it to!
