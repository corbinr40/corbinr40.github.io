About
After receiving a letter from your late grandfather, you uncover the location of a sunken ship just off the coast of a small island.

You spent all your money on some basic gear and the plane ticket to the island. When exploring for the sunken ship, you discover a trail of gems that can be traded in for cash to buy new supplies and upgrade your gear at the nearby village.

Features
A endless scroller diving game made in a well. The deeper you dive, the more treasures you can collect. 

Use the in-game shop to upgrade your diver's gear

10 upgrade levels

Game Background
This game was made for the Game Jam for Junior Devs and all assets (audio, textures, models, and code) were made within a week. This game is currently in development as I wish to continue to improve the game, some visuals, audio/music, and make the program more efficient.
