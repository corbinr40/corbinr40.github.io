About
Brackeys's 7th official Game Jam, with the theme being "This is not real".

I chose to make a "liminal space experience" in which you as the play must traverse hidden memories whilst being hunted by an unknown creature.

Unfortunately, I was quite ambitious with this project. I wasn't able to complete many of the tasks I would've liked to, such as: a character chat system, which would serve as a narrator; a few more levels; more tools/weapons; an opening scene; creating all custom assets; having custom sounds; and creating custom enemies.

This is a project I'd like to come back to, further polish, add in all the missing features, and ultimately finish the game I wanted to create.
