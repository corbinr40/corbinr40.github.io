About
A train time looping game where you have to figure out what is preventing it from making it to the final stop

Features
Made in Unreal Engine 5 

Inspired by time loop based games, and the movie Source Code directed by Duncan Jones, you’re stuck riding on a train and that’s forecast to not make its destination.

Play through the loop to learn who everyone is, and figure out who’s behind all of this. 

Branching narrative lines to learn from and gain information from people, but be sure not to use some previously learnt information before it naturally comes up.

Be conspicuous and be sure not to make a scene or raise anyone’s suspicions.
