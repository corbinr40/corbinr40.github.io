About
An unsuccessfully completed Game Jam submission where up to 9 players compete against each other in a touch typing battle royal game. The theme of the Jam was “Genre Mash”. Each player will have to fill up a progress bar and can use powerup to disadvantage the competitors. As the game goes on, the words will get progressively more difficult.

Features
A game jam made in Unity 

A genre smash of Battle Royale games and typing games (odd mix, I agree).  

You and 8 others battle out your spelling abilities and before the word hits the bottom.  

You can unlock power ups and special abilities to advantage you, but disadvantage your adversaries.
